Details About tasks done by each member:


Shabbir Bohra
1. Data cleaning like removing unwanted and redundant columns.
2. Data preparation 
1. Created new dummy columns for all categorical columns 
2. Created a new column like how old the car is which is a useful parameter for predicting Mileage 
3. Created Column called number cylinder car has by extracting this information from a column which has unstructured information present inside it.
4. Did scaling of variables for standardization
5. Split data into training and test set for model building purposes.
3. Data Exploration
1. Created various plots to find which variables have a relationship with Mileage of the car
I. The plot between Mileage and the number of cylinders of a car
II.  Mileage of car vs the type of fuel car uses
III. Mileage and the horsepower of the car engine 
IV. The type of transmission car has and the mileage.
V. The torque that the car engine generates and the fuel mileage.
VI. Mileage and the driveline type of car
4. Data Modeling 
Created Multiple linear Regression model for predicting mileage of the car in cities and on Highways 


Saema Ansari 
1. Naive Bayes
1. Split the data with 75% for training and 25% for testing.
2. Predict the “Classification” column i.e. whether it is manual transmission or automatic  transmission based on other relevant predictor variables like Torque, Horsepower, etc


Farah Masood
1. Data Exploration for Classification
   1. Create plots between different predictor variables to find which variables are best to use for manual transmission classification   
   2. Use results from data exploration to create classification model
